Training repo
=======================

In this repo I store all the solutions that I came up with for problems submitted on sites that aim at improving skills in programming and algorithmics.
This repo is organised as following: you will find a folder for each site that I visit and within a folder for each programming langage that I used. On the master branch only the solutions that were approuved are pushed. Other, work-in-progress, solutions are in their corresponding branches.
