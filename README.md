==============================

I use this repo to store possible solutions for the problems submitted at "HackerRank".
I do those exercises in order to improve in C++ and more generally in computer science - algorithms, etc...
I do think that I am really far from being good so if you find mistakes are believe that the code you see can be improved - even slightly - feel free to tell me!
